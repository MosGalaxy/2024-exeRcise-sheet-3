**Interpretation Guide**

1. Price Level Ratio (PLR) = PPP Conversion Factor / Market Exchange Rate
 
Where: 

**Price Level Ratio (PLR)**: Indicates the relative cost of goods and services compared to the US.

**PPP Conversion Factor**: Number of units of the local currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as 1 USD would buy in the US. PPP conversion factors are based on the 2011 ICP round.

**Market Exchange Rate**: Number of units of the local currency that equals 1 USD in the forex market.

- PLR < 1: Goods and services are generally cheaper in the country compared to the US. This means the local currency **has higher purchasing power domestically** than it would suggest through the market exchange rate. 

- PLR = 1: The cost of living in the country is similar to the US. The purchasing power of the local currency is **equivalent** to its value determined by the market exchange rate.

- PLR > 1: Goods and services are more expensive in the country compared to the US. The local currency **has lower purchasing power domestically** than the market exchange rate would suggest. 

2. GDP per Capita (PPP) = GDP (PPP) / Population

Where:

**GDP (PPP)**: Gross Domestic Product converted to international dollars using PPP rates.

**Population**: The midyear population of the country.

- **GDP per Capita (PPP)** measures the average economic output per person **adjusted for purchasing power parity**. It reflects the standard of living.
 
3. GDP per Capita (USD) = GDP (USD) / Population

Where:

**GDP (USD)**: Gross Domestic Product converted to US dollars using the market exchange rate.

**Population**: The midyear population of the country.

- **GDP per Capita (USD)** measures the average economic output per person based on market exchange rates. It reflects nominal income and **does NOT reflect purchasing power differences**.
